# Use of useContext with example creating real life scenerio where use context is used to pass data from one component to another.

useContext is a React hook that allows functional components to consume context that has been created by the React.createContext API. Context provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props manually at every level.


# Here's a real-life use case of useContext:

Scenario: Imagine you're building a multi-language website, and you want to provide a way for components to access the current selected language throughout your application without passing it down as a prop to every component.
